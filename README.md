MVP Ionic Wrapper for mapsted SDK

I have created a simple Ionic App that calls getBuildingInfo() from Mapsted Native SDK for Android.

## How to test

Clone the repo, then install the packages using:
```sh
npm install
```

Sync files just in case:
Run the app with ionic cli:
```sh
npx cap sync
```

Use Android studio to open the "android" folder and try the app

* IT NEED TO BE TESTED ON ANDROID *
